# About {{ site.title }}

As the central place to find news releases, events, and featured stories, University of Idaho News is an important record of the activities and achievements of the university community. However, in autumn 2015 the University of Idaho updated its web platform and older items risk becoming incompatible with the new system. To ensure continued access to the unique content of UI News, University of Idaho Library captured feed items in their web context as of September 2015. The archive contains more than 20,000 items ranging from 1997 to 2015.

Please note: to preserve basic functionality outside of the original content management system, all JavaScript and external dependencies found in the original web pages and email messages have been removed.
